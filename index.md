 <h3><p align="center">What Is This?</p></h3>
        
<p>This is my latest and greatest project. I have spent the past three months developing a 2D fighitng game, currently named Project V, with my hand-made 2D fighting game framework.
        Both the game and framework were develoepd from scratch with C++ and the SFML API. Currently the game is in a playable pre-alpha state with a good 90% of the mechanics implemented. 
        Below is a video and a downloadable demo of the current build.</p>
        
<h3><p align="center">Features</p></h3>

<p>The game and framework have the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All gameplay mechanics have been implemented.</li>
          <li>Support for two players simulationiously. </li>
          <li>DInput and XInput Controller support</li>
          <li>Dynamic detection of controllers (Only at startup in current build)</li>
          <li>Configurable controls (Not available in current build)</li>
          <li>Marvel vs. Capcom Partner System</li>
          <li>Support for a number of different fighting game style inputs.</li>
          <li>Marvel vs. Capcom-like combo system</li>
        </ul>
 
 <h3><p align="center">Demo Features</p></h3>

<p>In the demo, Player 1 has one playable character, Ryu, and one playable assist character, Ryu. Player 2 has ne playable character, Ryu, and one Support only Assist, Saki. The demo does not have a win/lose condition and instead functions more like a Training mode.</p>
<p>The gamplay is very reminiscent of Marvel vs Capcom 3. There are Light, Medium, Heavy, and Special buttons and to combo you must press each button in ascending order (L to M to H to Sp). Any move can be canceled into Special Moves such as Hadouken or into a Hyper Move such as the Shin Shoryuken.</p>
<p>Partners can be summoned to provide a helpful boost in battle. Be it to attack from afar or to help extend your combo, simply press the Assist button and your partner will jump on screen to help.</p>
<p> In the latest build playable Assist characters have been added. With this additional moves can be done. A Cross-Assault can be done by holding down the Assist button. Inputting QCF + Assist will use up one special bar and perform a Snap Back which will swap out the opponent wth his Assist, if playable. Lastly, a Hyper Swap can be done, while performing a Hyper Attack, input the motions for your assist's Hyper Attack, and your assist will swap and perform the desired Hyper Attack.</p>
